## 📖 About the Project

The **MNIST dataset** contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) each sized 28x28 pixels. The goal is to train a CNN model that can accurately predict the digit in each image.

This project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- CNN architecture design
- Model training & evaluation
- Accuracy visualization
- Testing on random samples
